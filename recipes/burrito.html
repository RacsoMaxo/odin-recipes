        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs flank or skirt steak</li>
            <li>1/4 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>4 extra-large flour tortillas (10-inch or larger)</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked mexican or cilantro lime rice</li>
            <li>1 cup refried or black beans, heated</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pico de gallo</li>
            <li>1/2 cup guacamole</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded monterey jack or cheddar cheese</li>
            <li><em>Optional: sour cream, hot sauce, or sliced jalapeños</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the Steak</strong>
                <ul> 
                    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the orange juice, lime juice,
                        olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt,
                        and pepper to create the marinade. Place the steak in a large
                        resealable bag or dish, pour the marinade over it, and refrigerate
                        for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Cook the Steak</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your grill or a large skillet to medium-high heat. Remove the
                        steak from the marinade and discard the excess liquid. Grill the steak
                        for 3-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until your desired doneness
                        is reached.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Rest and Chop Meat</strong>
                <ul>
                   <li>Transfer the cooked steak to a cutting board and let it rest for at least
                    5-10 minutes. This keeps the juices in the meat. Slice the steak thinly against
                    the grain, then chop into small, bite-sized pieces.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Warm Tortillas</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Warm the large flour tortillas so they are soft and pliable, which prevents
                        them from tearing when rolled. You can wrap them in a damp paper towel and
                        microwave for about 20 seconds or heat them in a dry skillet for a few seconds
                        on each side.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Assemble the Burrito</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lay a warm tortilla flat. Spread a layer of refried beans down the center,
                        followed by a generous portion of the chopped carne asada. Top with cooked rice,
                        guacamole, pico de gallo, and shredded cheese. Add sour cream, hot sauce, or sliced
                        jalapeños if using.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Roll the Burrito</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fold in the sides of the tortilla over the filling, then fold the bottom edge up and
                        over the ingredients. Tuck the filling in tightly and continue rolling forward to create
                        a secure, compact burrito. Serve immediately or wrap in foil for easy handling. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
