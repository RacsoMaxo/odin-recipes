        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tacos de Asada deliver a signature combination of seasoned beef and fresh
            toppings. Thin slices of marinated steak are cooked until tender and packed 
            into soft corn tortillas. Served with lime, crispy white onion, and bright 
            cilantro, this dish creates a perfectly balanced bite.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs flank or skirt steak</li>
            <li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 white onion</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>12-16 small corn tortillas</li>
            <li>3-4 large limes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Steak
                <ul> 
                    <li>In a large, non-reactive bowl or a resealable plastic bag,
                        combine all the marinade ingredients: orange juice, lime juice,
                        olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt, 
                        pepper, and chopped cilantro. Add the steak, turning to coat both
                        sides completely. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up
                        to 8 hours for deeper flavor. Avoid marinating for too long
                        (over 8-12 hours) as the citrus can break down the meat's texture.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Prepare Toppings
                <ul>
                    <li>While the steak marinates, prepare your toppings. In a small bowl,
                        mix the finely diced white onion and some chopped cilantro leaves to
                        create a simple relish. Set aside.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Grill the steak
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade,
                        letting any excess drip off (discard the used marinade). Place the steak
                        on the hot grill and cook for approximately 3 to 5 minutes per side for
                        medium-rare, or until your desired doneness is reached.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Rest and Dice Meat
                <ul>
                    <li>Transfer the cooked steak to a cutting board and let it rest for 5-10 minutes
                        before slicing. Resting the meat is crucial for keeping it juicy. Slice the
                        steak thinly against the grain, then chop the strips into small, bite-sized
                        pieces.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Warm the Tortillas
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat the corn tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 20-30 seconds
                        per side, or wrap them in a slightly damp paper towel and microwave for a minute.
                        Keep them warm in a towel-lined basket or foil to prevent them from drying out.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Assemble the Tacos
                <ul>
                    <li>Place two warm corn tortillas on a plate (double-stacking helps prevent breakage).
                        Add a generous amount of the chopped carne asada, then top with the onion and cilantro
                        mixture. Squeeze a fresh lime wedge over the filling just before eating <em>(add any optional salsa as desired).</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
