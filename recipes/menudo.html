        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Tripe Preperation</strong>
                <ul> 
                    <li>If using bleached (white) tripe, soak it in several 
                changes of cold water for a few hours to remove the chlorine smell.</li>
                    <li>If using unbleached (grey/brown) tripe, clean it 
                        thoroughly under cold water and trim any excess fat.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Initial Boil and Aromatics</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 900g honeycomb
                        tripe and 2 pig trotters.</li>   
                    <li>Boil for 5 minutes, then drain, discard the water, and
                        rinse the tripe and trotters clean of any scum.</li>
                    <li>Wash the pot clean and return the newly cleaned tripe and trotters.</li>
                    <li>In the pot, add 10 cups water, 1 large onion, 1 head garlic,
                        5 cilantro stalks, 1 tbsp black peppercorns, 2 bay leaves,
                        1 tsp cumin seeds, 2 tsp Mexican oregano, 4 chiles de árbol,
                        3 tbsp kosher salt, and 2 tbsp vinegar.</li>
                    <li>Cover, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and
                        simmer for 3 hours.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the heat and cool to room temperature.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Processing and Straining</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove the tripe, brush off any spices, and slice into ½" x 2" strips.</li>
                    <li>Remove trotters, strip meat/tendon, and roughly chop the meat.</li>
                    <li>Strain the stock through a double mesh strainer into a bowl,
                        pressing on the solids.</li>
                    <li>Wash out the pot and return the newly chopped tripe and trotters.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Chili Base Preperation</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) with the rack in the lower middle position.</li>
                    <li>Tear open 115g dried guajillo chiles; discard stems and seeds.</li>   
                    <li>Flatten chiles on a foil-lined baking sheet and spritz with cooking spray.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 5 minutes (until sweet/peppery aroma develops; do not burn).</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and cover with very hot tap water to rehydrate for 15–20 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Final Assembly and Simmer</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drain the chiles and blend with about half of the reserved stock until smooth
                        (add more stock if needed for blending).</li>
                    <li>Strain the chili mixture through a double mesh strainer into the pot with the 
                        tripe/trotters.</li>
                    <li>Pour the rest of the stock through the strainer into the pot, pressing any 
                        remaining solids.</li>
                    <li>Add 3 cups cooked white hominy into the pot (If canned: wash and soak in cold
                        water to remove the "canned" taste before adding).</li>
                    <li>Add 2 tbsp vinegar, 2 tbsp evaporated cane sugar, 2 cloves garlic, 1 tsp
                        mexican oregano, ½ tsp ground cumin, and salt lightly to taste.</li>
                    <li>Simmer uncovered for about an hour, until the tripe is colored and the soup
                        is thick. Check salt and adjust as needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Serving</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>For best flavor, let it rest overnight.</li>
                    <li>Serve with chopped onions, cilantro, and lots of lime.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
