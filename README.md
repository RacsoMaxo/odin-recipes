Hello, All! 

Within this project, I will be creating a (basic) 'website' that holds links
to a variety of recipes. As my 3 recipes, I chose foods that I love. Menudo, Tacos de Asada, and Burritos de Asada.


At first, I was upset with myself for choosing such difficult recipes, but at the end, I appreciated the challenge they brought. Given the complexity of the recipes (menudo in particular), I was able to use most (if not all) of the skills we have learned thus far.

As I was building my pages, I found that I was very fond of how things look. I have slight OCD, so structure and cleanliness are super important to me. I am excited to see how this helps me (or holds me back) with my projects in the future. 

Here is to starting this journey of learning something new! Thank you to all that came before me and good luck to all that will come after.
